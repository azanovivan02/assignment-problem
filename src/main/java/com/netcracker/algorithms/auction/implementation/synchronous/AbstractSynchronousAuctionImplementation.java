/**
 * Synchronous implementation of the auction algorithm.
 *
 * I created a common parent for all synchronous implementations because
 * they all share the concept of "auction round" (distinct phases within "epsilonscaling phase"
 * which are marked by synchronization points).
 *
 * Even within this "auction round" all synchronous algorithms have the same actions except
 * during making bids. Here each implementation has its own specifics:
 *   - Single threaded implementation uses single bid task for all people
 *   and only a single search task per person.
 *   - Jacobi implementation has several bid tasks, which are executed in parallel. Within bid
 *   task each person still has only one search task (i.e. parallel across the bids).
 *   - Gauss-Seidel implementation has only one bid task for all people, but each person
 *   has several search tasks (i.e. parallel within bid).
 *   - Hybrid is parallel both within and across bids.
 *
 * All other stages (i.e. bid aggregation, bid processing, price and assignment updating) happen
 * without any concurrency.
